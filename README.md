# RunPod Worker Template

[![RunPod](https://img.shields.io/badge/RunPod-Ready-success)](https://runpod.io?ref=badge)

This repository serves as a starting point for creating your own custom RunPod Serverless worker. It provides a basic structure and configuration that you can build upon.

## Getting Started

1.  **Use this template:** Create a new repository based on this template or clone it directly.
2.  **Customize:** Modify the code and configuration files to implement your specific task.
3.  **Test:** Run your worker locally to ensure it functions correctly.
4.  **Deploy:** Connect your repository to RunPod or build and push the Docker image manually.

## Customizing Your Worker

- **`src/handler.py`:** This is the core of your worker.
  - The `handler(event)` function is the entry point executed for each job.
  - The `event` dictionary contains the job input under the `"input"` key.
  - Modify this function to load your models, process the input and return the desired output.
  - Consider implementing model loading outside the handler (e.g., globally or in an initialization function) if models are large and reused across jobs.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Add any Python libraries your worker needs to this file. These will be installed via `uv` when the Docker image is built.
- **`Dockerfile`:**
  - This file defines the Docker image for your worker.
  - It starts from a [RunPod base image (`runpod/base`)](https://github.com/runpod/containers/tree/main/official-templates/base) which includes CUDA, mulitple versions of python, uv, jupyter notebook and common dependencies.
  - It installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` using `uv`.
  - It copies your `src` directory into the image.
  - You might need to add system dependencies (`apt-get install ...`), environment variables (`ENV`), or other setup steps here if required by your specific application.
- **`test_input.json`:** Modify this file to provide relevant sample input for local testing.

## Testing Locally

You can test your handler logic locally using the RunPod Python SDK. For detailed steps on setting up your local environment (creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies) and running the handler, please refer to the [RunPod Serverless Get Started Guide](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/get-started).

1.  **Prepare Input:** Modify `test_input.json` with relevant sample input for your handler.
2.  **Run the Handler:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure your virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed
    # The script automatically uses test_input.json
    python src/handler.py
    ```
    This will execute your `handler` function with the contents of [`test_input.json`](/test_input.json) as input.

## Deploying to RunPod

There are two main ways to deploy your worker:

1.  **GitHub Integration (Recommended):**

    - Connect your GitHub repository to RunPod Serverless. RunPod will automatically build and deploy your worker whenever you push changes to your specified branch.
    - For detailed instructions on setting up the GitHub integration, authorizing RunPod, and configuring your deployment, please refer to the [RunPod Deploy with GitHub Guide](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/github-integration).

2.  **Manual Docker Build & Push:**
    - For detailed instructions on building the Docker image locally and pushing it to a container registry, please see the [RunPod Serverless Get Started Guide](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/get-started#step-6-build-and-push-your-docker-image).
    - Once pushed, create a new Template or Endpoint in the RunPod Serverless UI and point it to the image in your container registry.
